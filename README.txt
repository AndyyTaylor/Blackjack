To run the game:

cd <path to main file>
./main

Controls
WASD to move around
E to interact with a button
B to add a bet (displayed in terminal window)
1-5 to customise players (displayed in terminal window)

Things to keep in mind!
The +player -player and new round buttons lag (I regen the vertices for all the cards.. Ik its bad but ah well)
